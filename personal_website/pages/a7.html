              1. Describe career goals (5 years after graduation) and plans to achieve these goals.
            </button>
            <div id="assignment-q1" class="collapse mb-3">
              <div align="justify">
                <p>I don't know exactly where I want to be in 5 years, but I've been thinking about in staying in Tijuana for at least 2 years after graduation so I will have more job experience, and then apply for a <b>Junior</b> position in a (not that big) tech company, and work there until haveing 5 years of experience so 
                  I can start to apply for senior positions.
                </p>
                <p> Since I recently got a job and I will not graduate until May next year, I will be working as a trainee on this company called Insule for 11 months. So when I graduate I will have 1 year of experience. Also, right now I can't think of an area in what I want to get fully involved since I don't have much 
                  of experience in getting involved in an specific area, since this is my second job in software, but I can say is the first (formal) job, because the last one only lasted like 3 months and I feel that I didn't learn that much.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At the momment, the most I like is <b>font-end</b> development, altough my job will focus on Android development, I'm planning on keep learning front-end stuff, so by the time I have enough experience, I will start applying for a Junior position, preferably as a Front-end developer. 
                </p>
                <p>So, I can say that, I'm planning to stay in this company this year, then If possible, stay for at least 1 more year. I will consider if to stay, or not, in the same company, after having completed 2 years. Then, if I decided not to remain in the compay, I will start applying for 
                  <b>Associate engineer</b> positions in front-end. I will decide if I like Andriod development that much or not. If I decided to continue on Front-end, and after applying for associate engineer positions, there are 2 main options:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Staying at least, 1 more year working here in Tijuana, to get more experience as front-end developer, could be in the same company or another.</li>
                  <li>Apply to work remotely for an US company to work as well as a Front-end developer, or even Fullstack, for at least 1 year.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  The company doesn't have to be a big tech company, but at least a company where I can learn more so I can use that job as a bridge to apply for a big tech after.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By this time, I will have 3 years of experience, if I don't decide to stay in the same place by the time I have enough experience to become a Junior, I will start to look and apply for a Junior position, if I decided to stay I will just ask to move forward to a higher position from the currently one. I like to grow fast 
                  so I will not wait that much to move forward, I would probably look for another company if necessary if they decide not to promote me to a higher position. It may sound silly, but I like to push myself into situations where I can I can do better, LOL
                </p>
                <p>
                  After getting a Junior position (in the US preferably), <b>I don't yet if it will be Front-end, but at the time let's it will be</b>, I will work there for at least 1 to 2 years. I don't know why, but I think that after having certain knowledge, being in the same place for so long, will make me stuck to one place and not make me move forward, <b>unless</b> it is a great place to work.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So after working for 2 more years, and having 5 years of experience, and assuming that I get to work on a US company, will come the fun part, <b>start to apply for senior positions.</b> I don't know if I know this right, but after working straight for 5 years, I will consider somebody as a <em>senior</em>, if this is not the case, or
                   as always <b>DEPENDS</b> on something, I would like you to let me know professor Jaquez.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I would probably work for at least 3 to 5 years as a senior developer, then I would to apply for management position, I don't know, maybe become a <b>SCRUM MASTER</b>, or a <b>PRODUCT OWNER</b>, or something related with <b>SOFTWARE MANAGEMENT</b>, I don't know, I like management stuff, so maybe I will take this path after working for at least 10 years. So I think that this will be the momment to start to 
                  do some certifications and management jobs, I think that would be a good way to start on that path.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The only problem right now, is that I don't how the Software field will change in the next couple of years, I don't know if all these plans that I have right now will be viable. One thing that I can say is that, after working in the Tech Industry and having saved some money by working as a software manager, I would like to build my Music Recording Studio, yes, and recording studio. 
                  I would like to have my own recording label, even if it's small. And for the record, I'm have a degree on Music production and audio engineering, yes, I have a degree, so this Computer Sciences degree will be my second career HEHEHE.
