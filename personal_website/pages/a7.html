              1. Describe career goals (5 years after graduation) and plans to achieve these goals.
            </button>
            <div id="assignment-q1" class="collapse mb-3">
              <div align="justify">
                <p>I don't know exactly where I want to be in 5 years, but I've been thinking about in staying in Tijuana for at least 2 years after graduation so I will have more job experience, and then apply for a <b>Junior</b> position in a (not that big) tech company, and work there until haveing 5 years of experience so 
                  I can start to apply for senior positions.
                </p>
                <p> Since I recently got a job and I will not graduate until May next year, I will be working as a trainee on this company called Insule for 11 months. So when I graduate I will have 1 year of experience. Also, right now I can't think of an area in what I want to get fully involved since I don't have much 
                  of experience in getting involved in an specific area, since this is my second job in software, but I can say is the first (formal) job, because the last one only lasted like 3 months and I feel that I didn't learn that much.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At the momment, the most I like is <b>font-end</b> development, altough my job will focus on Android development, I'm planning on keep learning front-end stuff, so by the time I have enough experience, I will start applying for a Junior position, preferably as a Front-end developer. 
                </p>
                <p>So, I can say that, I'm planning to stay in this company this year, then If possible, stay for at least 1 more year. I will consider if to stay, or not, in the same company, after having completed 2 years. Then, if I decided not to remain in the compay, I will start applying for 
                  <b>Associate engineer</b> positions in front-end. I will decide if I like Andriod development that much or not. If I decided to continue on Front-end, and after applying for associate engineer positions, there are 2 main options:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Staying at least, 1 more year working here in Tijuana, to get more experience as front-end developer, could be in the same company or another.</li>
                  <li>Apply to work remotely for an US company to work as well as a Front-end developer, or even Fullstack, for at least 1 year.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  The company doesn't have to be a big tech company, but at least a company where I can learn more so I can use that job as a bridge to apply for a big tech after.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By this time, I will have 3 years of experience, if I don't decide to stay in the same place by the time I have enough experience to become a Junior, I will start to look and apply for a Junior position, if I decided to stay I will just ask to move forward to a higher position from the currently one. I like to grow fast 
                  so I will not wait that much to move forward, I would probably look for another company if necessary if they decide not to promote me to a higher position. It may sound silly, but I like to push myself into situations where I can I can do better, LOL
                </p>
                <p>
                  After getting a Junior position (in the US preferably), <b>I don't yet if it will be Front-end, but at the time let's it will be</b>, I will work there for at least 1 to 2 years. I don't know why, but I think that after having certain knowledge, being in the same place for so long, will make me stuck to one place and not make me move forward, <b>unless</b> it is a great place to work.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So after working for 2 more years, and having 5 years of experience, and assuming that I get to work on a US company, will come the fun part, <b>start to apply for senior positions.</b> I don't know if I know this right, but after working straight for 5 years, I will consider somebody as a <em>senior</em>, if this is not the case, or
                   as always <b>DEPENDS</b> on something, I would like you to let me know professor Jaquez.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I would probably work for at least 3 to 5 years as a senior developer, then I would to apply for management position, I don't know, maybe become a <b>SCRUM MASTER</b>, or a <b>PRODUCT OWNER</b>, or something related with <b>SOFTWARE MANAGEMENT</b>, I don't know, I like management stuff, so maybe I will take this path after working for at least 10 years. So I think that this will be the momment to start to 
                  do some certifications and management jobs, I think that would be a good way to start on that path.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The only problem right now, is that I don't how the Software field will change in the next couple of years, I don't know if all these plans that I have right now will be viable. One thing that I can say is that, after working in the Tech Industry and having saved some money by working as a software manager, I would like to build my Music Recording Studio, yes, and recording studio. 
                  I would like to have my own recording label, even if it's small. And for the record, I'm have a degree on Music production and audio engineering, yes, I have a degree, so this Computer Sciences degree will be my second career HEHEHE.

              2. Topic that I'm passionate about.
            </button>
            <div id="assignment-q2" class="collapse mb-3">
              <div align="justify">
                <p>OK, so for this part I was struggling to think about a topic I'm REALLY passionate about, and nothing came to my mind. Maybe it is because I like many things but I might have never really about what of those things I'm really passionate about.</p>
                <p>So instead I will talk about a topic I found really interesting lately, which is <b>Would the AI in the Music Industry replace musicians, songwriters, composers, and singers?</b></p>
                <p>I don't know exactly when I found the post on the internet talking about this, but I found it really interesting, and since I'm a music producer and an audio engineer, and also a musucian, it intrigues me.</p>
                <h4>Will AI replace musicians in the music industry?</h4>
                <p>As many other study fields and industries, there are divided ideas about Artificial Intelligence, and questions about this topic as well, <b>will AI replace us?</b> <b>is our work be obsolete because of the AI?</b>, in my personal point of view, I will say <em>"No, not yet, in some years, maybe yes".</em>
                 Some people say that AI is actually helping them to unlock their creatity powers, and enhance their work. Others are using AI to FULLY compose and write songs, even to interpret and sing songs. So, who are we going to believe?</p>
                 <p>
                  As for today, there are pleny of AI tools that allow people to create and compose songs, by just simply text promtpting. This might sound crazy, but no, it is just simple as that, the AI technology is getting better and better every day. Just to mention of these tools: <b>MusicLM</b> by Google, <b>Synthesizer V Studio</b> by Dreamtonics, 
                  <b>Voice AI Text To Song Generator</b> by Voicemod, <b>Vocaloid</b> by Yamaha, and many others, and recently I found out about a tool made by OpenAI, and as we know, the most popular AI development company today in 2023, named <b>Jukebox</b>. <br>
                  You can visit their websites for more specific information about the tool:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>MusicLM by Google: <a href="https://google-research.github.io/seanet/musiclm/examples/">MusicLM: Generating Music From Text</a></li>
                  <li>Synthesizer V Studio by Dreamtonics: <a href="https://dreamtonics.com/en/synthesizerv/">Synthesizer V Studio</a></li>
                  <li>Voice AI Text To Song Generator by Voicemod: <a href="https://www.voicemod.net/text-to-song/">Text to Song Generator</a> They also have other interesting AI tools for voice.</li>
                  <li>Vocaloid by Yamaha: <a href="https://www.vocaloid.com/en/">Vocaloid 6</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>There are MANY other AI tools, these are just a few of them.</p>
                <p>
                  So, with all of these tools out on the market, some of them being free, others not so much, and others being publicly available, people are still saying <em>"Artificial Intelligence is helping musicians unlock their creativity"</em>, and I think this is not completely false, if we were in 2021 and we were arguing about this back then, but I think differently now that we are in 2023, 
                  and AI has been growing exponentially. There is an article from 2021, posted by Forbes, that talks about this and mentions that, back then <em>"artist felt about that they were entering a golden age of creativity, powered by artificial intelligence, that can push music in new directions".</em>, I mean, this is not completely false, and I may argue that, ok yeah this will be a big deal for musicians, music producers, composers, 
                  audio engineers,etc., but the problem is that 2 years later, now being 2023, AI has gone to far evolving and that idea is not completely true after all.
                </p>
                <p>
                  YES! I think that AI is transforming the Music Industry from top to bottom, and maybe in some years we will see songs fully written and composed by AI, so the question for producers, audio engineers, musicians, composers, songwriters, singers, would be, <b>will you get on the train?</b>. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Going back to the article, they mentioned that <em>Grammy-nominated producer Alex da Kid, used IBM AI Watson, to analyze five years' of hit songs, as well as cultural data from films, social media, and online articles to figure out a theme for an AI-generated song that fans would enjoy, and the final song <b>Not Easy</b>, reached number four on the iTunes Hot Tracks chart within 48 hours after its release.</em> <br>
                  At first glance, this might sound crazy, and some might think, how is it possible that a <em>computer software</em> will compose a highly listened song?, but now in 2023 with the crazy evolution of AI, is not that surprising. To be honest, maybe back then in 2021 I would have been a little bit skeptical about it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So, <b>will AI replace humans in the music industry?</b>, well, because of all the new AI tools available, MANY people fear that they will lose their jobs, or that the value of human creativity is going to be diminished even more than it already has been, and even that they will be left behind as technology makes business models obsolete. Besides, it is worth mention that stuff like this is already happening, and some people might think 
                  that it is quite alarming.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Well, YES, at this point it is crealy inevitable that AI is going to strongly impact the music industry and the future of music, but that ain't happening right away. The problem is that AI tools are becoming better and betters everyday.
                </p>
                <p>Let's talk about <b>MusicLM</b>, an AI model created by Google that can generate high-fidelity music from text descriptions suchs as "calm ambience forest music with a violin and a guitar playing the melody along with a piano in the background". <br>
                The model takes in the text prompt and can cast the process of conditional music generation pieces as a <em>sequence-to-sequence</em> modeling task, generating music at 24 kHz that remains consistent over several minutes. <br>
                Another experiments claim that MusicLM can outperforms previous systems both in audio quality and adherence to the text description it takes as input. Additionally, Google research department has demonstrated that the tool can be conditioned on both text and a melody 
                in that it can transform whistled and hummed melodies according to the style described in a text prompt. I know, this sounds CRAZY, and also they have publicly release some samples and their dataset for this model.</p>
                <p>For example, these are MusicLM samples from their website:</p>
                <table class="table">
                  <thead>

                <p>
                  There are tons of samples in their website. If you want to hear more samples go pay them a visit at <a href="https://google-research.github.io/seanet/musiclm/examples/">MusicLM: Generating Music From Text</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Just to be clear, the actual <b>MusicLM</b> tool is not publicly available to use yet, but it will not take that long to be accessible to everyone and I know for sure that when that happens, every, at least I think, audio engineers and freelance music producers will be using it. As a audio engineer, I can use it to add samples of melodies or beats to an actual recording, and by recording I'm referring to go to an actual 
                  recording studio and having a setup with microphones and stall the necessary stuff for a recording session.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The problem I see here is that, <b>what if musicians or singers don't want to pay for a recording studio anymore?</b> They can simply use the tool to add the necessary melodies or beats to record their own stuff with needing an audio engineer at all. YES, I think that's scary for an audio engineer that has invested in audio tools and has his/her own recording studio.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another interesting AI tool I recently discovered, that can also be a HUGE impact on the music industry, it is called <b>Synthesizer V Studio</b>, and it is a BANGER. This software, lets you add vocals to any composition you are having. Just like any other Digital Audio Workingstation, (a DAW is an equivalent to an IDE in software), it lets you choose a note, let's say a piano, and with every note, you can type in words, 
                  and the AI will sing those words in the given note, also you can extend the note for as many seconds you want, and the AI will extend the vocals to match the length of the note. Now, THAT'S CRAZY!
                </p>
                <p>For example, let's hear a composition made by this tool:</p>
                <div>
                  <h5>Erode - Synthesizer V SOLARIA Original Demo Song (Vocal Modes Update Demonstration)</h5>

                <p>
                  I will just mention one example of this AI trend in the music industry, I can't mention all of them because I will finish typing, and you will finish reading, so yeah. 
                </p>
                <p><b>Vocaloid</b> is an AI-based technology created by Yamaha to fully support the musical expressiveness of creators from all perspectives, that offers a more natural singing voice with allowing you to add expressive vocals on top of it. </p>
                <p>
                  Let me show you about this AI tool:
                </p>
                <div>

                </p>
                <p>
                  So yeah, It is a HUGH controversy around AI in the music industry, there is also a pretty nice article where several famous singers and pop and hip-hop artists are being interviewed about this topic. You can check the full article here <a href="https://www.complex.com/pigeons-and-planes/how-will-ai-change-the-music-industry">How Will AI Impact The Future of Music?</a>
                </p>
                <p>In my personal point of view, and as I have been mentioned, YES AI is huge and it will impact and change the Music Industry forever, when will that happend? Well, I think sooner than you expect. <b>Will AI replace musicians, singers, composers, songwriters, and even audio engineers?</b> Well, NOT RIGHT NOW, but eventually it may happen. The real deal here is that whether the people be ready to embrace this new era, and the AI technology 
                that will become even better everyday? If the people can use this technology to move forward and to adapt to the new demand, maybe they can lose their fear of being replaced and look for opportunities that may come with the use of AI.</p>
